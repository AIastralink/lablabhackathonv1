# AI-Driven Smart Hotspot

## üìå Overview
The **AI-Driven Smart Hotspot** is an Android-based application designed to enhance **public sector network management**, particularly in **schools, healthcare facilities, and government offices**. By leveraging **AI-powered routing**, this application allows mobile devices to act as **intelligent Wi-Fi access points**, optimizing **bandwidth, network congestion, and energy consumption**.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **AI-Driven Routing:** Automatically connects users to the **strongest and least congested access point**.
- **Dynamic Hotspot Management:** Turns smartphones into **Wi-Fi access points** to extend public networks.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** AI detects weak signals, predicts dropouts, and **optimizes performance in real time**.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Smart power management **reduces battery consumption** when acting as an access point.
- **Security & Fair Usage:** Implements **authentication, encryption, and bandwidth allocation**.

## üìå How It Works
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ User installs the app and connects to a public network.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Device intelligently switches between client mode & access point mode, extending the network to others.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ AI determines the best access point for users, optimizing performance and load balancing.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-time monitoring tracks network health, predicting failures and suggesting solutions.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Smart power management minimizes energy drain, ensuring sustainability.

## üìä Expected Impact
- **50% increase in network coverage** in public institutions without new infrastructure.
- **30% reduction in energy consumption** via AI-powered efficiency.
- **Improved internet access** for students, healthcare professionals, and public workers.
