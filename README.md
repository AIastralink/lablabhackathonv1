# AI-Driven Smart Hotspot

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Driven Smart Hotspot** is an Android-based application designed to enhance **public sector network management**, particularly in **schools, healthcare facilities, and government offices**. By leveraging **AI-powered routing**, this application allows mobile devices to act as **intelligent Wi-Fi access points**, optimizing **bandwidth, network congestion, and energy consumption**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **AI-Driven Routing:** Automatically connects users to the **strongest and least congested access point**.
- **Dynamic Hotspot Management:** Turns smartphones into **Wi-Fi access points** to extend public networks.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** AI detects weak signals, predicts dropouts, and **optimizes performance in real time**.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Smart power management **reduces battery consumption** when acting as an access point.
- **Security & Fair Usage:** Implements **authentication, encryption, and bandwidth allocation**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
### **Frontend (Android UI & Logic)**
- **Kotlin / Jetpack Compose** – For building an intuitive and scalable Android UI.
- **XML Layouts** – UI structuring for lower-level customizations.

### **Backend & AI Algorithms**
- **TensorFlow Lite / Scikit-learn** – AI-based predictive routing and load balancing.
- **Firebase / Django REST API** – For authentication and network analytics (optional).
- **Python (AI Model Development)** – Machine learning for predictive maintenance and congestion optimization.

### **Networking & System APIs**
- **Android Wi-Fi Manager & Hotspot APIs** – For managing Wi-Fi connections and creating mobile access points.
- **Wi-Fi Direct API** – To establish peer-to-peer connections when needed.

### **Security & Performance Optimization**
- **WPA3 Encryption & OpenVPN** – Ensuring secure Wi-Fi sharing.
- **Battery-Aware AI Model** – Smartly optimizes power consumption.

## 📌 How It Works
1️⃣ **User installs the app** and connects to a public network.
2️⃣ **Device intelligently switches between client mode & access point mode**, extending the network to others.
3️⃣ **AI determines the best access point** for users, optimizing performance and load balancing.
4️⃣ **Real-time monitoring tracks network health**, predicting failures and suggesting solutions.
5️⃣ **Smart power management minimizes energy drain**, ensuring sustainability.

## 📊 Expected Impact
- **50% increase in network coverage** in public institutions without new infrastructure.
- **30% reduction in energy consumption** via AI-powered efficiency.
- **Improved internet access** for students, healthcare professionals, and public workers.
